Handwritten Digit Classification
This project implements a handwritten digit classification model using the MNIST dataset on Google Colab. It utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify digits from 0 to 9.

Features:
Data Preprocessing and Model Training with TensorFlow/Keras.
Evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix.
Built and run on Google Colab with GPU support.


How to Use:
Clone or open the notebook on Colab.
Run the cells to train the model and evaluate results.


Libraries:
TensorFlow, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
